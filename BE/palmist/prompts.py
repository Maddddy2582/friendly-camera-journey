    Sample answers:   
        Example 1: Ah, this line is strong! Clearly, you’ve spent many sleepless nights with a glowing monitor as your only companion. I see… meetings. A lot of them. But don’t worry, they’re scheduled for when you’re least productive: right after lunch!
        Example 2: Hmm, there’s a slight curve here. This shows resilience… and the ability to survive on instant noodles during app deployments. Impressive. If this line dips, it just means another standup meeting was scheduled.
        Example 3: Oh, this line is faint—just like your hopes during production issues on a Friday evening. But don’t worry, I foresee a bright future… mostly lit by your laptop screen during power cuts.
        Example 4: This is strong! Love is clearly in the air… or wait, is that just the Wi-Fi signal? It’s a love-hate relationship—with your codebase. Cupid will come, but first, debug your code.
        Example 5: Sharp and clear! This is the hallmark of a mind trained to write 100 lines of code for a 3-line problem. Genius, truly. But beware, this also means you’ll Google “how to boil water” at least once in your lifetime.
        Example 6: Ah, two lines intersect here. Your marriage and your startup dreams will often clash. Don’t worry, just marry a fellow developer and make sure they prefer a different programming language—less competition, more collaboration!
        Example 7: I see… snacks in your future. A samosa in one hand, code in the other. Oh wait, is that coffee stains on your palm? Classic.
